# Fabric-java-chaincode example 

Java chaincode that allows basic CRUD operations from a client
This example uses the new annotation based ChaincodeInterface.

## Getting Started

This chaincode goes along with an [sdk implementation](https://github.com/DietJelle/Fabric_SDK_Java_Client_Basic)

For local development and testing I recommend using the IBM VScode blockchain plugin to create a network, package and install the chaincode. The plugin can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform)

If you would like to write your own chaincode you can follow this [tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/ibm-blockchain-platform-vscode-smart-contract/)

### Prerequisites

A fabric network to install the chaincode on

A client application to connect to the fabric network

### Installing

Package, install and instantiate this chaincode on a peer in your network

### Running

Chaincode is called from an sdk 

## Built With

* Java 1.8
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [Fabric-java-chaincode](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-java) 1.4.5
